Lunatech was founded in 1993 as an IT consulting, product research and development team. We specialise in custom solutions with emphasis on integration of diverse information systems. We have intimate knowledge of both Java and Scala. We donâ€™t tie ourselves to specific technical solutions. This allows us to offer customer and project-focused solutions. Through the use of embedded teams we understand the customers needs better and we are able to reduce the time to complete modifications.
