It is a challenging task to build a large-scale web application, there are fundamental characteristics to take into account: for example, efficiency, safety and robustness. Finagle is a asynchronous, Netty based JVM RPC system made by Twitter which makes it easy to build high available clients and servers in Java and Scala. And it can even simplify your application architecture. Here I want to show you how powerful Finagle is.

One of the main principles of functional programming is to avoid side-effects. For the most part, working with immutable instances would be sufficient to satisfy that principle. But sometimes it is needed to do some sideeffects e.g. when we want to read from file. One straight-forward way of doing it is to get a BufferedSource, and process it using an iterator as shown below.
